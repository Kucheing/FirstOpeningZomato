    "## **How to Conduct a Two Sample T-Test in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we are going to see how to conduct a two-sample T-test in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This test has another name as the independent samples t-test. It is basically used to check whether the unknown population means of given pair of groups are equal. tt allows one to test the null hypothesis that the means of two groups are equal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**\n",
    "Before conducting the two-sample t-test using Python let us discuss the assumptions of this parametric test. Basically, there are three assumptions that we can make regarding the data groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the two samples data groups are independent.\n",
    "- Whether the data elements in respective groups follow any normal distribution.\n",
    "- Whether the given two samples have similar variances. This assumption is also known as the homogeneity assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that even if our data groups don’t follow the three assumptions discussed above. This is because there is an alternate test present if our data do not fall in the normal distribution or we can transform the dependent data group using different techniques like square root, log, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two sample T-Test in Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider an example, we are given two-sample data, each containing heights of 15 students of a class. We need to check whether two different class students have the same mean height. There are three ways to conduct a two-sample T-Test in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Method 1: Using Scipy library**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scipy stands for scientific python and as the name implies it is a scientific python library and it uses Numpy under the cover. This library provides a variety of functions that can be quite useful in data science. Firstly, let's create the sample data. Now let's perform two sample T-Test. For this purpose, we have ttest_ind() function in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](../Imports/image8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that by default equal_var is True\n",
    "\n",
    "Before conducting the two-sample T-Test we need to find if the given data groups have the same variance. If the ratio of the larger data groups to the small data group is less than 4:1 then we can consider that the given data groups have equal variance. To find the variance of a data group, we can use the below syntax,\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax: print(np.var(data_group))\n",
