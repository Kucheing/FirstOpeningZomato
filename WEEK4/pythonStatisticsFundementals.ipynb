    "# **Python Statistics Fundamentals: How to Describe Your Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Understanding Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "**Descriptive statistics** is about describing and summarizing data. It uses two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The quantitative approach** describes and summarizes data numerically.\n",
    "**The visual approach** illustrates data with charts, plots, histograms, and other graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can apply descriptive statistics to one or many datasets or variables. When you describe and summarize a single variable, you’re performing **univariate analysis**. When you search for statistical relationships among a pair of variables, you’re doing a **bivariate analysis**. Similarly, a **multivariate analysis** is concerned with multiple variables at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you’ll learn about the following types of measures in descriptive statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Central tendency** tells you about the centers of the data. Useful measures include the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "- **Variability** tells you about the spread of the data. Useful measures include variance and standard deviation.\n",
    "- **Correlation or joint variability** tells you about the relation between a pair of variables in a dataset. Useful measures include covariance and the correlation coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Population and Samples\n",
    "In statistics, the **population** is a set of all elements or items that you’re interested in. Populations are often vast, which makes them inappropriate for collecting and analyzing data. That’s why statisticians usually try to make some conclusions about a population by choosing and examining a representative subset of that population.\n",
    "\n",
    "This subset of a population is called a **sample**. Ideally, the sample should preserve the essential statistical features of the population to a satisfactory extent. That way, you’ll be able to use the sample to glean conclusions about the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Outliers\n",
    "An **outlier** is a data point that differs significantly from the majority of the data taken from a sample or population. There are many possible causes of outliers, but here are a few to start you off:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Natural variation in data\n",
    "- Change in the behavior of the observed system\n",
    "- Errors in data collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection errors are a particularly prominent cause of outliers. For example, the limitations of measurement instruments or procedures can mean that the correct data is simply not obtainable. Other errors can be caused by miscalculations, data contamination, human error, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn’t a precise mathematical definition of outliers. You have to rely on experience, knowledge about the subject of interest, and common sense to determine if a data point is an outlier and how to handle it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choosing Python Statistics Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many Python statistics libraries out there for you to work with, but in this tutorial, you’ll be learning about some of the most popular and widely used ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python’s** statistics is a built-in Python library for descriptive statistics. You can use it if your datasets are not too large or if you can’t rely on importing other libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NumPy** is a third-party library for numerical computing, optimized for working with single- and multi-dimensional arrays. Its primary type is the array type called ndarray. This library contains many routines for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SciPy** is a third-party library for scientific computing based on NumPy. It offers additional functionality compared to NumPy, including scipy.stats for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas** is a third-party library for numerical computing based on NumPy. It excels in handling labeled one-dimensional (1D) data with Series objects and two-dimensional (2D) data with DataFrame objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Matplotlib** is a third-party library for data visualization. It works well in combination with NumPy, SciPy, and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, in many cases, Series and DataFrame objects can be used in place of NumPy arrays. Often, you might just pass them to a NumPy or SciPy statistical function. In addition, you can get the unlabeled data from a Series or DataFrame as a np.ndarray object by calling .values or .to_numpy().\n",
    "\n",
    "# Getting Started With Python Statistics Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in Python statistics library has a relatively small number of the most important statistics functions. The official documentation is a valuable resource to find the details. If you’re limited to pure Python, then the Python statistics library might be the right choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to start learning about NumPy is the official User Guide, especially the quickstart and basics sections. The official reference can help you refresh your memory on specific NumPy concepts. While you read this tutorial, you might want to check out the statistics section and the official scipy.stats reference as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn pandas, then the official Getting Started page is an excellent place to begin. The introduction to data structures can help you learn about the fundamental data types, Series and DataFrame. Likewise, the excellent official introductory tutorial aims to give you enough information to start effectively using pandas in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "matplotlib has a comprehensive official User’s Guide that you can use to dive into the details of using the library. Anatomy of Matplotlib is an excellent resource for beginners who want to start working with matplotlib and its related libraries."

If 𝑛 is even, then the median is the arithmetic mean of the two values in the middle, that is, the items at the positions 0.5𝑛 and 0.5𝑛 + 1.\n",

If the data points are 2, 4, 1, and 8, then the median is 3, which is the average of the two middle elements of the sorted sequence (2 and 4). The following figure illustrates this:\n",

    "The upper dataset again has the items 1, 2.5, 4, 8, and 28. Its mean is 8.7, and the median is 5, as you saw earlier. The lower dataset shows what’s going on when you move the rightmost point with the value 28:\n",

    "If you increase its value (move it to the right), then the mean will rise, but the median value won’t ever change.\n",
