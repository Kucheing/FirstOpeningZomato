    "# Z score for Outlier Detection - Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlier detection is an important task in data as identifying outliers can help us to understand the data better and improve the accuracy of our models. One common technique for detecting outliers is Z score. It is a statistical measurement that describes how far a data point is from the mean, expressed in terms of standard deviations. It helps us to identify if a data point is relatively higher or lower than the mean and how far it deviates from the average value.\n",

    "**Z-Score Formula:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = X − μ over σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- x = Value of the data point\n",
    "- μ = Mean of the data\n",
    "- σ= Standard deviation of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a survey, it was asked how many children a person had. Suppose the data obtained from people is\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 15, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the value 15 is clearly an outlier as it deviates significantly from the other data points. The Z-Score for this data point will be much higher than the rest, showing it as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see why it works so well:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple Calculation: It’s easy to calculate using just the mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "- Standardized Measure: Z-Score standardizes the data which makes it easier to detect anomalies across different datasets with varying units or scales.\n",
    "- Identifying Extremes: Find outliers which are the data points that lie far from the mean. Since Z-Score measures how far a data point is from the mean, it’s perfect for identifying extremes in the data.\n"

    "While Z-Score is effective, there are a few important considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assumption of Normal Distribution: Z-Score works best when the data follows a normal distribution. If our data is skewed, other methods like IQR (Interquartile Range) might be more appropriate.\n",
    "2. Threshold Selection: The threshold of 3 is commonly used but it can be adjusted depending on the data and the application.\n",
    "3. Handle Multiple Outliers: In large datasets, there might be several outliers. It’s important to decide whether to remove them or investigate further.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the Z-score method, we can quickly identify and deal with outliers which improves the accuracy of our data analysis and statistical models."
