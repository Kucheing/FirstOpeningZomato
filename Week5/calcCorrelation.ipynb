    "DataFrame.corr() method in Pandas is used to calculate the correlation between numeric columns in a DataFrame. Correlation shows how strongly two columns are related. The result is returned as a new DataFrame called a correlation matrix, where each value ranges from -1 to 1.\n",

    "- 1: perfect positive correlation\n",
    "- -1: perfect negative correlation\n",
    "- 0: no correlation\n",

    "- Correlation is 0.97, which is close to +1 meaning Height and Weight increase together and and have a strong positive relationship, but not perfectly proportional.\n",
