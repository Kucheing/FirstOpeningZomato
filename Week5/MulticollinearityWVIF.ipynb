    "# **Detecting Multicollinearity with VIF - Python**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated which leads to unstable coefficient estimates and reduces model reliability. This makes it difficult to identify the individual effect of each predictor on the dependent variable. The Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is used to detect multicollinearity in regression analysis. In this article, we’ll see VIF and how to use it in Python to identify multicollinearity."

    "# Mathematics behind Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)\n",
    "\n",
    "VIF shows how much the variance of a regression coefficient increases due to multicollinearity. For each variable, we run a regression where that variable becomes the dependent variable and the remaining variables act as predictors. This gives an R-squared(R2) value that tells how well one variable can be predicted using the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for VIF is:\n",
    "\n",
    "VIF = 1 over 1 - Rpow2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- R² ranges from 0 to 1.\n",
    "- A higher R² means the variable is highly predictable from other variables -> higher VIF.\n",
    "- If R² is close to 1, the variable is almost fully explained by others -> strong multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since VIF increases as R² increases, a higher VIF indicates higher multicollinearity. In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- VIF > 5 -> noticeable multicollinearity\n",
    "- VIF > 10 -> severe multicollinearity (action needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this formula helps us correctly spot multicollinearity and decide if we should remove or combine variables.\n",

    "# VIF Interpretation\n",
    "- VIF ≈ 1: No correlation with other predictors\n",
    "- 1 < VIF ≤ 5: Mild to moderate correlation (usually fine)\n",
    "- VIF > 10: Strong multicollinearity -> take corrective steps"
